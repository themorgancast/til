# Today I Learned
### Or: An active log of what crossing back over from leadership to IC work looks like
Author: Morgan Whaley, recovering engineering manager, aspiring returning frontend engineer

## Background
I spent 4 years as an engineering manager after 12 years as a strong frontend engineer. While I consulted and helped direct coding decisions as a manager, I stayed out of the code for the most part during my leadership tenure. My goal now is to ramp back up, fill gaps from the past 4 years, remind myself I haven't completely [lost my edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xG4oFny2Pk), and refresh my perspective and passion for code.

## How This Works
When I worked at LivingSocial 🥀🪦⚰️ in 2015, we kept a TIL repo where people could put anything useful/helpful/interesting. I'm a kinetic learner and need to take active notes to help embed any information I passively consume. The folders contain Markdown files in different disciplines, sometimes tied to a specific learning curriculum, sometimes just around a common theme. I get the win-win of a quick reference guide and a place to capture WTF I'm taking in.

And, hey, we all know this beats Yet Another Todo List app, right?
